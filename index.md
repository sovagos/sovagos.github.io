    <td align = "justify"><br> Before getting into Data Science, I earned a PhD in Economics and did research as an Assistant Professor at the <a href="https://www.rug.nl/research/eef/">University of Groningen</a>. I am excited about applied microeconomics, especially when it is about measuring the impact of education policies. Even though I do not officially work as an academic, I love spending my time on my reseach projects. </td>
